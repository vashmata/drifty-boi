This was created to demonstrate the idea of commit messages.

-Good commit messages are short (under 50 characters preferably).

-Good commit messages have a capitalized first word.

-Good commit messages are written in present tense.

-If you want to include more details, you are encouraged to do so in the text box for details.

-HOWEVER, good commits are small incremental changes, because this means you can easily revert those small changes rather than undoing enormous modifications to your code when really you just wanted to change an OR to an AND or something.

-I keep the standard from Space Concordia Robotics of prefacing the message with [#x] where x is the number for the issue you're working on. You can put the number at the end of your commit message if you want, but I strongly recommend putting it in your commit message, because:

-When you put the issue number, it automatically turns into a link to your issue which makes it really convenient. It also helps you keep track of the changes you made which pertain to a specific issue. If you want, you can mention multiple issues like [#x][#y].
