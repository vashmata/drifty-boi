# drifty-boi
Drift-control semi-autonomous car for a mechatronics project at Concordia University.

##Main Goals
Have speed control and traction control implemented on a remote-controlled car. This requires a communications system, both microcontroller-to-microcontroller style and car-to-controller style.

##Optional Goals
Have braking control on the back wheels, as well as drift control. It would also be fun to have the car play music or avoid obstacles with a LIDAR
