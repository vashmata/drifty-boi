## I2C Test Code

*These Arduino sketches were entirely written by others in online tutorials (credits are in the code).*

Code used to quickly validate the I2C circuits built for on-board communication. The code was only slightly modified to test communication between **one master** (Arduino Nano) and **two slaves** (Arduino Nano, Teensy 3.5). It worked without any unexpected errors.
