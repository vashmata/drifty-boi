## RF24 Test Code

*These Arduino sketches were mostly written by others in online tutorials (credits are in the code).*

Code initially used to test nRF24L01 communication between an Arduino Nano and Teensy 3.5. This proved unsuccessful for yet-unknown reasons. It may be that the RF24 library does not support the Teensy 3.5/3.6 (unclear from documentation).

Ultimately, the library was used successfully to test nRF24L01 communication between two Nanos. Specifically, testing what types of data could be sent (any primitive data type can be sent).
